## [1.10.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Compat mode: outbound-initiated dials to fresh peers**. In v1.10.1, a
  compat-mode (WSS-only) daemon's first SYN to a peer went raw through the WSS
  pipe because `routing.WriteFrame` only wrapped frames in `BeaconMsgRelay`
  after the blackhole heuristic flipped the peer to relay mode (3 misses, ~8s
  silence). For brand-new peers, the unwrapped frame reached the beacon as an
  unknown protocol byte and was dropped silently — every outbound-initiated
  dial timed out. Managed claws (Docker on Render/Railway/Lambda, UDP-blocked
  corp networks) could RECEIVE traffic via the bridge but couldn't INITIATE
  connections to UDP-only peers. Fix: a `forceRelay` flag on `routing.Manager`
  set by `TunnelManager.ConnectCompat`, so every outbound write in compat mode
  is BeaconMsgRelay-wrapped regardless of blackhole state.

### Added
- `tests/zz_compat_dial_test.go` — end-to-end regression test: a compat daemon
  dials a UDP peer's echo service through an in-process beacon and asserts the
  three-way handshake completes and echo data flows both ways.
- `tests/compat/zz_real_beacon_test.go` — 4 integration tests exercising the
  production beacon binary's WSS↔UDP bridge with real `bwss.Server` +
  `dwss.Transport` (not the synthetic in-memory bridge used by the existing
  4-cell matrix).
- `beacon.Server.WSSAddr()` and `WSSIsConnected(nodeID)` — exposed for tests
  that bind to `:0` and need to wait for post-handshake WSS registration.

### Platform compatibility

Researched egress policies of common managed-claw / agent-sandbox platforms.
Verified live: a fresh compat daemon (`node_id=205787`) fetched the
weather-agent list from `list-agents` over **TCP/443 (beacon WSS) + TCP/9000
(registry), zero UDP**. From that, the picture is:

| Platform                | UDP egress         | TCP arbitrary port   | UDP mode works  | Compat mode works |

**v1.10.2 fully unblocks**: Render (the original Garry Tan report case).
**Already worked in v1.10.0 UDP mode**: Railway, Fly.io, Lambda, Cloud Run,
Modal, E2B, Daytona.
**Still blocked in v1.10.2**: platforms enforcing the Docker AI Sandbox
HTTP-proxy-only egress model (Replit Agent, Devin, locked-down Cursor
sandboxes). These need an `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`-honoring transport and
a registry-over-WSS bridge — tracked for v1.10.3.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Heartbeat signature verification** (Garry Tan bug report #1): the registry-client
  signer captured `d.identity` once at startup; after key rotation, heartbeats kept
  signing with the stale identity and got rejected. Signer now reads `d.identity`
  under `d.identityMu` on every call. Affected every daemon that rotated keys
  after registration; symptom was a `"registry: signature verification failed"`
  loop with re-register every 60 s and no peer connectivity.

### Added
- **Compat mode**: tunnel Pilot packets over WebSocket Secure to the beacon for
  daemons in UDP-blocked environments (Docker on Render/Railway/Vercel/Lambda,
  restrictive corp networks). Opt-in via `-transport=compat` on the daemon;
  default behavior unchanged. Live at `wss://beacon.pilotprotocol.network/v1/compat`.
  See [docs/SPEC-compat-mode.md](docs/SPEC-compat-mode.md) and
  [docs/firewalls](https://pilotprotocol.network/docs/firewalls).
- `pilotctl skills disable` / `enable` — safe removal of the daemon's auto-installed
  agent skill files. Strip-only on co-inhabited files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `AGENT.md`, `SOUL.md`); delete in our own subdirs. OpenClaw plugin allow-list
  restored from `.pilot-bak` snapshot. Idempotent.
- Marker block self-disclosure: the `<!-- pilot:begin ... -->` comment now embeds
  `Inserted by pilot-daemon. Remove with: pilotctl skills disable` so anyone
  opening their agent config file in one read knows what it is and how to remove it.
- `data_b64` field in dataexchange inbox messages (opt-in via `-dataexchange-b64`):
  lossless base64 alongside the existing `data` string for binary payloads
  (e.g. zlib-compressed HealthKit envelopes).
- `cmd/pilot-ca` offline tool to mint the future production Pilot root CA and beacon
  leaf certs; see [docs/RUNBOOK-pilot-ca.md](docs/RUNBOOK-pilot-ca.md).

### Changed
- `install.sh` post-install banner now points at `pilotctl skills disable` for users
  who want to opt out of skill auto-injection.
- Beacon's relay worker checks for a WSS-connected destination before the UDP
  tier-1/2 lookups, so existing UDP daemons reach compat-mode peers transparently
  (the bridging happens entirely on the beacon).
- Registry `LookupPublicKey(nodeID)` exposed for in-process beacon to authenticate
  WSS daemons against registered pubkeys.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-05

- Rekey storm fix: `decryptFailDropGrace` (3 s) prevents tearing down a freshly-installed
  `peerCrypto` before in-flight frames from the old key have drained
- AEAD divergence recovery: 5 consecutive auth failures drop `tm.crypto[peer]` and trigger
  fresh key exchange automatically
- Relay-flag pinning: `relayPinned` replaces "auto-clear after 3 direct receipts" heuristic
  that caused relay/direct flapping every ~60 s in production
- Cold `pilotctl` latency: 10–30 s → ~600 ms; warm: ~170 ms

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-30

- Registry lock contention closed end-to-end
- P1-010 tunnel-desync recovery: salvage in-flight plaintext on peer-initiated rekey
